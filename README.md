# Colemak For ABNT2 (PT-BR)

Made this for personal use, but I think most of brazilian fellows would like to use this also; 

This was made with MSKLC: 
 - Imported the ABNT2 default layout
 - then changed the letter positioning to match Colemak Vanilla and
 - add the Ç for the same pinky finger just one row different; 
 
 The layout:
